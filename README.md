Calgary's Corporate Energy Consumption and having it visualised using an open source Dataset from Open Calgary website. Reference: https://data.calgary.ca/


## We will be answering the following questions initially,
  1. What is the recent trend of year-on-year energy consumption in the city?
  2. What’s the distribution of the energy production i.e., how much energy is being produced from renewable resources like solar and non-renewable resources like        natural gas?
  3. In the end we will sum up different corporates and facilities energy consumption trends over the year and what’s their main source of resource of energy?
